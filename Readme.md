# Lab 4. Examines linked lists. 


 The goal of this program is to compare a simple array list, a simple linked list, and the java built-in array list. 
 The program reads 2000 names into a sting array then uses that array to test the add and remove methods
 of the lists. The simple array list and the simple linked list are created by I, and the built-in array list is 
 maintained by the Java Developers. The built in array list should be the fastest since it is optimized by the 
 Java Developers.
